# Importing files

From time to time, you may encounter files which are not in a format Zettlr recognizes, for instance Word documents or Open Document files. If you need to edit these files and want to do it in Zettlr, you have the option to import the files by choosing the appropriate menu item (in the `File` menu).

> **Note**: Importing files requires Pandoc to be installed. Please see [the setup instructions for Pandoc](../installing-pandoc.md) on how to install it on your computer.

The files will be imported into the **currently active directory**, so make sure to select the appropriate directory where you would like to import the files to prior to importing them.
