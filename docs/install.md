# Installation

The installation of Zettlr is very easy and takes only a step on every operating system. Zettlr is cross-platform, so it will run on your system, no matter which one. Zettlr comes pre-built for macOS, Windows and Debian-based and RedHat-based Linux systems (Ubuntu, Gnome, Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Fedora, RedHat and the like).

If you want to run Zettlr on other Linux-Systems like Arch or on ARM-devices (such as a Raspberry), you'd have to create a package by yourself. There's plenty of easy tutorials on how to build electron apps on the web. Please refer to the [supported platforms for electron apps](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/support.md) to stay up to date which platforms are supported.

## Windows (7 or newer)

To install Zettlr on Windows, just download the app from the [download page](https://www.zettlr.com/download) and double click to open it. If you wish to install Zettlr for all users, it is installed to the main `Program Files`-Directoryâ€”in this case you'd have to give it elevated rights during setup (it will automatically ask for your permission). You don't need any rights if you install it for yourself.

To uninstall Zettlr, simply run the Uninstall.exe either from the directory itself or use the comfortable option in your system's settings. If you want to completely remove all data associated with the app, also remove the directory `C:\Users\<your-user-name>\AppData\Roaming\Zettlr`.

## macOS (10.10 or newer)

To install Zettlr on macOS, simply download the dmg-file from the latest release and mount it. Then drag the Zettlr-icon into your Applications directory and you're done!

To uninstall Zettlr, simply remove the Zettlr.app from your Applications directory. If you want to completely remove all data associated with the app, also remove the directory `/Users/<your-user-name>/Library/Application Support/Zettlr`.

## Linux (Debian 8/Ubuntu 12.04/Fedora 21 or newer)

There are prebuilt `deb`- and `rpm`-packages for linux systems. Simply install the package on your system.

To uninstall, follow the usual steps it takes to remove a package (usually through the graphical installer application or via `dpkg`). If you also want to remove all data associated with the app, also delete the `/home/<your-user-name>/.config/Zettlr` directory.

## Updating the app

The application checks for new updates each time you start the app. You can also manually trigger the search for updates by using the respective menu item from the Help-menu. If there is a new version available, Zettlr will show you a dialog that contains both the new version's number, your current version and a changelog with all features and bug fixes the new version contains. You can then open the download page to download the new package. Simply install it over your current installation, it will take care of removing the old version first. All data will be retained and migrated to the new version.
