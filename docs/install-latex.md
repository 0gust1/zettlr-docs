# Installing LaTeX

Markdown works best if combined with `LaTeX` to create beautiful PDF files. To do so, you'd have to install a `TeX`-distribution along Zettlr. Don't worry: You won't need to learn any `LaTeX` to use it. But you'd have to install it.

Installing the software works exactly the same as any other software: On Windows and macOS you'll need the installer package, while on Linux you can use your packet manager to install a distribution.

The recommended distributions are:

- Windows: [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/download)
- macOS: [MacTex](https://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html) (_Attention: It suffices to install the Basic Tex, which is much smaller than the full version_)
- Linux: [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (install the texlive-base packet: `sudo apt install texlive-base`)

> You can install LaTeX at a later time. Simply use the menu item from the Help menu to open up the overview page where you can immediately see all available distributions.
