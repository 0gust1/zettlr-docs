# Zettlr Documentation

Thank you for choosing Zettlr as your reliable writing companion. On these pages, we help you get started with the app to supercharge your own writing. If you haven't yet gotten your own copy of Zettlr, [head over to the download page](https://www.zettlr.com/download) and get it for your operating system!

## Getting Started

To see how to install Zettlr on your system, please consult the [setup instructions](install.md). It is also recommended to set up Pandoc and LaTeX right away to enable all importing and exporting functionality of Zettlr. Don't worry, it's really easy!

When you're set, choose an entry-point into the documentation:

## Quick Start

Don't want to waste time? Head over to our [very-quick start guide "Zettlr in 5 Minutes"](5-minutes.md)! After five minutes you'll know everything you need to know.

## Guides

Have a look at our user guides so that you can learn all workflows. The guides are not focused around features, they are focused around workflows. Here you can read about popular workflows, step by step.

Setting up Zettlr as a note-taking app can replace solutions based on quick entry such as **Evernote**, **OneNote**, or **Bear**. A Zettelkasten setup can replace apps such as **Bear**, **The Archive** or workflows combining several apps, such as **nvALT**. Enabling all features will turn Zettlr into serious competition for **Ulysses**.
